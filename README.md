# Passman: A Secure Password Manager
> A project developed for the Secure Programming and Web Application Security course.

## Introduction

**Passman** is a secure, locally-run password manager application designed to combine secure programming practices with modern web security techniques. Its goal is to implement robust security measures such as access control, safe password storage, and secure handling of user credentials while providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.

This project explores the technologies used in real-world secure applications and demonstrates how to integrate them into a functional service while prioritizing security.

## Project Architecture

The application is designed using the **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** architecture, which is ideal for applications that need to support multiple devices and platforms.

- The **backend** is built using Java Spring, offering REST API endpoints for communication.
- The **frontend** is developed with React, a modern JavaScript library for creating dynamic user interfaces.

This architecture ensures scalability and compatibility with diverse systems, leveraging HTTP as the communication protocol.
